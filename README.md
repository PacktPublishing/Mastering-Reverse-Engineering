**Re-engineer your ethical hacking skills**

## What is this book about?
If you want to analyze software in order to exploit its weaknesses and strengthen its defenses, then you should explore reverse engineering. Reverse Engineering is a hackerfriendly tool used to expose security flaws and questionable privacy practices.In this book, you will learn how to analyse software even without having access to its source code or design documents. You will start off by learning the low-level language used to communicate with the computer and then move on to covering reverse engineering techniques.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Learn core reverse engineering 
Identify and extract malware components 
Explore the tools used for reverse engineering 
Run programs under non-native operating systems 
Understand binary obfuscation techniques 
Identify and analyze anti-debugging and anti-analysis tricks

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
while (true) {
    for (char i = 1; i <= 255; i++) {
      if (GetAsyncKeyState(i) & 1) {
        sprintf_s(lpBuffer, "\\x%02x", i);
        LogFile(lpBuffer, (char*)"log.txt");
      }
    }
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a security engineer or analyst or a system programmer and want to use reverse engineering to improve your software and hardware, this is the book for you. You will also find this book useful if you are a developer who wants to explore and learn reverse engineering. Having some programming/shell scripting knowledge is an added advantage.
